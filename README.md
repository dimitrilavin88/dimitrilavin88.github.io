Dimitri Lavin's Personal Portfolio

In the following repository, there is a collection of completed and undergoing projects.

MATLAB PROJECTS
A compilation of notable projects demonstrating models and simulations of physical systems.
The COVID-19 file simulates aerosolized bodily fluids (sneezing and coughing) that 
get filtered through masks of differing thread counts and use of electrostatic layers. The
Vicsek files simulate swarming behavior of birds by showing how a bird's individual flight
pattern is influenced by the flight patterns of other birds in close proximity. The Venus Flytrap 
files replicate a similar simulation to the Vicsek simulations, however fly movement is random
and once they come to close to static flytraps they are "eaten" and thus removed from the simulation.

OMEGLE PROJECT
This is a project that is still in development. The getting_started file includes the base framework 
for the Chrome extension that will be used for Omegle. The nsfw_model and NudeNet folders are other
open source repositories that contain neural nets and machine learning code built for NSFW detection.
